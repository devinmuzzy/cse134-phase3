I set up a google analytics accound and added the necessary external js to get it to work. I did this so that I can track how people interact with my website. Once I have more data on how people interact with my website, I will be able to optimize and edit it so that users will have a better experience. This will make users associate me with good quality work, and will fufill the purpose of this webstite.
